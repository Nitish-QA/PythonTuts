'''
Sets are used to store multiple items in a single variable.
A set is a collection which is unordered, unchangeable*, and unindexed.
Set items are unchangeable, but you can remove items and add new items.
Duplicates not allowed
Since it is unordered so indexing in sets  not allowed
'''
print('-----------1---------------')
myset = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}
print(myset)

print('----------------2-----------------')
#  It can have all multiple datatypes
thisset = {"apple", "banana", "cherry", True, 1, 2} # here 'true and '1' are considered duplicates
print(thisset)

print('-------------3----------------')
