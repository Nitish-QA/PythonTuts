Set:
Sets are written with curly brackets.
Set items are unchangeable, but you can remove items and add new items. 	
Set items are unordered and unindexed, meaning you cannot refer to items by index like you can in lists and tuples.
Sets do not allow duplicate items. If you try to add a duplicate item, it will be ignored.
The values True and 1 are considered the same value in sets, and are treated as duplicates:
Sets can contain elements of multiple data types, including numbers, strings, and other objects


List:
Lists are created using square brackets
List items are ordered, changeable, and allow duplicate values.
list is changeable, meaning that we can change, add, and remove items in a list after it has been created.
 allows duplicates: Since lists are indexed, lists can have items with the same value
 A list can contain different data types:
 
 
Tuple:
Tuples are created using round brackets.
Tuple items are ordered and indexed, like lists.
Tuples are immutable, meaning you cannot change, add, or remove items after the tuple has been created.
Tuples can contain duplicate items, similar to lists.
Tuples can contain elements of multiple data types, just like lists and sets.


Dicstionary:
Dictionaries are used to store data values in key:value pairs.
Dictionaries are written with curly brackets, and have keys and values
Dictionary items are ordered, changeable, and does not allow duplicates.
As of Python version 3.7, dictionaries are ordered. In Python 3.6 and earlier, dictionaries are unordered.
Dictionaries are changeable, meaning that we can change, add or remove items after the dictionary has been created.
Dictionaries cannot have two items with the same key
values in dictionaries can contain different data types

String:
Strings are sequences of characters and are written using either single quotes ('') or double quotes ("").
String items are ordered and indexed, meaning you can access individual characters using their index.
Strings are immutable, which means you cannot change their characters after they have been created.
Strings can contain duplicate characters, just like any other sequence.
Strings can contain any Unicode characters, making them versatile for representing text and data.

One liner:
Set: Unordered collection of unique elements.
List: Ordered, mutable collection of elements that may contain duplicates.
Tuple: Ordered, immutable collection of elements that may contain duplicates.
Dictionary: Unordered collection of key-value pairs, where keys are unique and associated with their corresponding values.
String: Immutable sequence of characters representing text or data.
