Creating a Class:
Let us now create a class using the class keyword.

class Details:
    name = "Rohan"
    age = 20


Classes are created by keyword class.
Attributes are the variables that belong to a class.
Attributes are always public and can be accessed using the dot (.) operator. 
Eg.: Details.name


Creating an Object:
Object is the instance of the class used to access the properties of the class Now lets create an object of the class.

Example:
obj1 = Details()
print(obj1.name)
print(obj1.age)

'self'  Parameter:
self represents the instance of the class. 
Self is always pointing to Current Object.
By using the “self”  we can access the attributes and methods of the class in python
1. Class methods must have an extra first parameter in the method definition. 
We do not give a value for this parameter when we call the method, Python provides it
2. If we have a method that takes no arguments, then we still have to have one argument.
3. This is similar to this pointer in java
